# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java, specifically when iterating over an array.  The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected version, `CorrectedArray.java`, shows how to fix this error by adjusting the loop condition.
